# FishFinder
FishFinder is a companion app for Animal Crossing: New Horizon for the Nintendo Switch. It enables a user to create a profile and track their progress toward catching all the fish in the game. Since some fish are only available at particular times of day, or certain months out of the year, the app will also calculate whether a fish they have not yet obtained is currently available. If not, the app will tell the user the soonest time that they can next catch a fish that they don't already have. These recommendations allow a user to methodically catch all the fish in the game until they have completed their collection.

## How to Use
First-time users of the app can use a textbox to create a new username for themselves. Return users select their name from the list, and your data will be populated into the app. After creating your username, click the square for each fish that you have already caught (if any). The app will automatically update, if necessary, for each fish you click. If you click one by mistake, you can simply click it again to unselect.
