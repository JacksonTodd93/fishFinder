There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Fish Finder

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A Tool for the Animal Crossing Completionist

## Summary ##
  > A core part of gameplay in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is catching fish that live in the waters on and around your island. With 80 unique kinds of fish in the game, collecting them all can be a fun challenge, but also daunting. This app will help you track your progress and let you know which fish to target next in your quest to collect all of them.

## Problem ##
  > If you're trying to collect all the fish in Animal Crossing, it can be difficult to keep track of your progress. Some fish are only available during certain months of the year or certain times of day, and the game doesn't make this information available to you.

## Solution ##
  > This app will take user input of fish they've already collected, then provide the user a simple statement of when and where they can next find a unique fish that is not already in their catalogue.

## Quote from You ##
  > "This is a simple and lightweight app that is intuitive to use, and can help you whether you're just getting started, or need a bit of help tracking down those last few pesky fish."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Spend one minute the first time you use the app to let it know which fish you've collected already, then you're off and running!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "After using this app, I was able to achieve my goal of collecting every fish on my island!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Grab your pole and let's go fishing!
