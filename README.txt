Notes:

1) This tool only works for Northern hemisphere right now

2) Coelacanth is omitted from the tool. It’s available year-round, 24 hours a day, but only when it’s raining.

3) Information for piranha is not fully correct. The piranha is unique in that it has two separate periods during the day when it is available, and the tool’s search mechanism does not yet account for this.

4) 'Rarity' is somewhat subjective, still working on this feature
